<h1 style="font-family:BlackChancery;color:white">Campus Saftey</h1>

<p style="font-family:Allembert�;color:#ECE5B6;font-size:20px">
��������������Welcome! Over the past 60 years, Berklee College of Music has developed into a world-renowned institution in the heart of a world-class city. Being situated in one of America's most historic and dynamic cities presents students, faculty, and staff with the prospects of a vast array of cultural, academic, and athletic offerings.<br /><br />

��������������Yet while Boston abounds with opportunities to experience life in a vibrant environment, an urban setting always has the potential for unsafe conditions or situations. With this in mind, Berklee's Public Safety Department is committed to providing a safe and supportive environment for the study of music. In keeping with that goal, Berklee continually revises existing policies and procedures to reflect today's security and safety issues.<br /><br />

��������������While we are dedicated to maintaining our campus as a safe, secure, and welcoming place to live and learn, a truly safe environment can only be achieved with everyone's active participation in the process. Put more clearly, public safety is everyone's responsibility, so the entire community must do their part in order to achieve the safest possible environment.<br /><br />

��������������We know that our internal community education and awareness efforts make a significant difference in providing a broad range of security and comfort for our community.<br /><br />
</p>

<h1 style="font-family:BlackChancery;color:white">Office of the Registrar</h1>

<p style="font-family:Allembert�;color:#ECE5B6;font-size:20px">

��������������The Office of the Registrar is one of the main student services offices on campus, maintaining and safekeeping your academic records and providing services and assistance from your first semester through graduation and beyond! We coordinate student course registration, check-in, and scheduling services; publish the Registration Manual twice annually (<a href="/pdf/registration/registration_manual.pdf">download the Current Registration Manual</a>); and provide degree and enrollment verification, as well as process transcript requests.<br /><br />

��������������The Registrar's Office is also responsible for evaluating transfer of credit from other institutions as part of a credit <a href="/admissions/general/credit_transfer_agreement.html">credit transfer agreement</a>, study abroad program, or as a <a href="file:///C:/Users/Mr.Civha/Desktop/New%20folder/admission.html">transfer student.</a> We're a one-stop service center for formerly enrolled students who wish to <a href="file:///C:/Users/Mr.Civha/Desktop/New%20folder/home.html">return to Berklee.</a> In addition, our staff provides graduation advising and services, and supports commencement activities.<br /><br />

��������������The Office of the Registrar also coordinates the student health insurance plan, serviced by Gallagher Koster Insurance Agency.<br /><br />
