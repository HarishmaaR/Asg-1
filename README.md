## Project Overview
 The theme of this project that I chose was "Let the music speak" which was promoting music college, specifically Berklee College of Music. It is the worldâ€™s preeminent college for the study of music, and students can experience all aspects of the music industry through an interdisciplinary curriculum. This website will primarily be for interested students to find out more about their interested courses and the environment of the college. Many students may find it hard to keep being updated about the college and find out their more preferred cousrses they may likely to be interested in. Hence this website can provide them with the knowledge about the college. Moreover, the new year freshies may not really understand the lifestyle and poilicies of the college so this website aims to provide them general information with the facilities and life in the college, promoting their college and attracting more freshies. 

## Design Process
This aim of this website is primarily for those who are interested to know more about the college and are interested to enroll in the college. I feel that my website achieves my aim due to it having few useful features and everything being in one place. This will in turn hopefully attract more freshies as more people will get to know the college and have a greater chance of reaching othes.
